# Implementation Plan — List Views + Detail views (Phase-2 UI system)

Spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-20-list-views-inline-expand-design.md` (§1–4)
Canon: `.claude/skills/style` (numbers) + `.claude/skills/wrangler-style` (decisions)
Audit: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-20-mockup-critique-log.md` (canon-compliance audit, 2026-07-21)
Mockups: `scratchpad/list-views.html`, `scratchpad/detail-views.html`
Branch: `claude/rental-wrangler-ui-research-rhd74v`

**Scope (Jac 2026-07-21 — "both, as one plan"):** List Views (spot-what's-on-fire cards) and the
three Detail views (Units / Rentals / Customers) ship as **one** build — they share the same element
layer (Signal · Gate · Stamp · Ref · Door), card grammar, and palette, so building them together keeps
the shared builders honest. Big *replacements* ride behind a `FEATURES` flag in `config.js` (`flagOn()`
reader) so backing the swap out is a runtime toggle.

**Not in this plan:** Comms/Inbox (§7), Trips ETA-Tracker (§8, mockup done), Dashboard/graphs (§5 —
Jac: "not ready for graphs"), the all-cards Sort redesign (Jac: after staging builds). Those get their
own plans when their turn comes.

## The element layer is the spine — build it ONCE, correctly

Everything below renders through five shared builders. Author these first; every surface consumes them.
The canon audit found the **same drift repeated** because these were hand-rolled per-spot instead of
centralised — so the plan is: **one builder per element, canon-correct, no per-spot variants.**

| Builder | Canon (wrangler-style §3 + style §7) | Audit fix baked in |
|---|---|---|
| `signal()` | coloured chip, read-only; **colour = `taskState()`**, **fill = `triggeredToday()`**; ONE chip radius; dark ink on fill (filled red = `--red-fill` + `--on-red-fill`) | status must route through `taskState`, **never hand-set** a colour (list-views `PROTECTION OFF` was hand-set yellow) |
| `gate()` | a Signal you can turn: same chip + **leading chevron**; **state colour, NEVER `--commit`** | clean in both mockups — keep it that way; `--commit` is Doors only |
| `stamp()` | plain fact: chip **text, no box, no colour** (`--txt-3`), stamped voice; overflow → `+N` | a fact must be a Stamp on BOTH polarities (list-views showed `PROTECTED` as Stamp but `PROTECTION OFF` as a boxed chip — pick one: both Stamp, or both real Signal state) |
| `ref(record, typeName)` | square accent-tinted backing + **the record's TYPE icon** + name (body voice); ONE chip radius; orange-marked = touchable | **every linked record is a Ref, everywhere** (incl. card **titles/headers**, unit/invoice sub-rows) — never plain text; **key the icon off `typeName`/`TYPE_ICON`, never a hardcoded user glyph** |
| `door()` | verb action, pill radius; commit/create → `--commit`; money → green; destructive → red; the one quiet Cancel = ghost; **toggle active segment = the filled Signal of the option's state**, orange only when the option carries no status | Insured/Uninsured toggle must show good/risk **state colour**, not plain accent-orange |

**Hard numeric rules (style):** one control height, one baseline, the size ladder, **ONE chip radius**
(collapse the `6/8/5px` split found in both mockups to a single token), WCAG floors (4.5 text / 3 UI),
the ≥90 CVD-separation floor, 60-30-10 accent budget. **colour = `taskState(record)`**, **fill =
`triggeredToday(record, ctx)`** — the two drift-proof functions; nothing hand-sets a status colour.

**Palette rules (frozen):** the ten locked tokens only, **no new colours**; **yellow = `#eed44b`** (NOT
the neon `#ffe14d` — CVD-rejected; detail-views had it wrong); **never pure `#fff`/`#000`** — on-fill inks
are `--on-red-fill`/`--on-commit` = `#fdfdfd`; **dark-only** — emit **no** `prefers-color-scheme:light`
or `[data-theme="light"]` blocks. Two type voices only (stamped mono for labels/chips/IDs/**numbers**
tabular; body-sans bold sentence-case for record names) — **dollar figures use the mono/tabular voice**
(detail-views had them in body-sans).

---

## Phases (app.js line-mapping = the atlas-grounded next step)

> The existing app is a single-file `app.js` with the R0–R25 `data-r` rulebook + CI guards. Exact
> `file:line` anchors per phase come from a **`/atlas` (CODE-MAP) pass** — the next step before coding, so
> the phases below are scoped by *concern*, not yet by line. Every UI element gets a `data-r` stamp;
> regen `rule-usage.js` (`node ci/gen-rule-usage.mjs`) when usage changes; new popups need a
> `WINDOW_CATALOG` entry. Cache-bust on any served-file change.

- **Phase 0 — `FEATURES` flag + shared chip-radius token.** Add the flag (default OFF); collapse the chip
  radii to one token in `style.css`. Verify: gates green.
- **Phase 1 — the element layer.** Author/normalise `signal()`, `gate()`, `stamp()`, `ref(record,
  typeName)`, `door()` to the table above; introduce `TYPE_ICON` and route `ref()` through it; ensure
  `taskState`/`triggeredToday` are the sole colour/fill source. This is where the audit fixes land once,
  for every surface.
- **Phase 2 — List Views.** The card grid (Units/Rentals/Customers/Trips/Categories + role Dashboard),
  the plate grammar (status-bar + stamped label + summary + rollup chip + chevron), Attention vs
  Lifecycle groups (never named after status), header colour = worst-item rollup (`red>yellow>blue>green>grey`),
  inline-expand + anchoring per spec §1–4.
- **Phase 3 — Detail views.** Units / Rentals / Customers plates + sections, all rendering through the
  Phase-1 builders; fix the specific drift (unit/invoice sub-rows → `ref()`; dollar figures → mono;
  Insured toggle → state colour; strip the light blocks).
- **Phase 4 — gates + ship prep.** `data-r` stamps + `rule-usage.js` regen; `WINDOW_CATALOG` for any new
  popup; full CI gate suite; cache-bust bump; then hand to `/deploy → /merge → /promote`.

## Decisions
- **Invoice line-item IDs = Ref (walkable)** — Jac, 2026-07-21. *May revert to Stamp-by-design later* —
  keep the render routed through the element layer so flipping Ref↔Stamp is a one-line change, not a sweep.
- Anything touching money/auth/PII/WO-completion stays on the main session (never delegated) per the
  build rules.

## Build log (`/build`, 2026-07-21 — "build as far as you can without me")

**Phase 0/1 (element layer)** — CLOSED earlier this session: `FEATURES.designV2` flag + `--chip-radius`
token (Slice 1); `refPill`/`unitPill`/`entityPill` icon-plate (`.ref-ico`), `ROWS.rentals` unit names
routed through `unitPill()`, group-header label/count split (Slice 2b) — the builder-coverage audit
Jac asked for ("is a reskin actually easy?") came back yes, with two small real exceptions, now closed.

**Phase 2 (List Views structural reshape)** — CLOSED earlier this session (Slice 2, integrated from a
Sonnet CSS pass against the mockup): pill radius/height unification, Ref radius fix, `--commit` wired,
record-name/number voice split, double-frame fix, group-label voice.

**Phase 3 (Detail views — "fix the specific drift") — CLOSED this run (Slice 3):**
- **Dollar figures → mono/tabular voice**: closed via ONE rule on `.derived` — the base app's own
  existing "this is a computed fact" marker that every `kv()`/`efld()` money field, the invoice ledger
  (`ledgerRow`'s `Subtotal/Tax/Total/Paid/Due`), and the category pricing engine already carry. Plus
  `.balline` (Customers' account-balance line), the one primary figure outside `.derived`. CSS-only,
  no app.js changes.
- **Insured/Uninsured toggle → state colour**: already correct in the real app (`segCtl` with
  `on-green`/`on-red`, true fills) — the audit finding was against the standalone mockup, not live code.
  Confirmed, left untouched.
- **Unit/invoice sub-rows → `ref()`**: already correct in the real app — customer swap, unit
  remove, WO #, invoice customer cell, category/status pills, and every history-timeline entry already
  route through `refPill`/`unitPill`/`entityPill`. Confirmed, left untouched.
- **Strip light-mode blocks**: none exist inside `html.dv2` CSS. Confirmed, nothing to strip.

**NOT built this run — deferred, not guessed (see hand-back report):**
- The mockup's `.plate`/accordion/KPI-grid/mini-calendar **structural reshape** of the three Detail
  views. This is a DOM/JS restructure (collapsible left-border-coded sections, a big-number card, a
  KPI strip, an inline mini-calendar) — a UX/information-architecture decision on par with Trips'
  multi-round review, not a "close the gap" fix. It hasn't been through the same interactive
  mockup-review cycle Trips/List-Views got, so it's deferred to its own reviewed pass rather than
  built blind.
- `.stall-amt` / `.jprice` mono-voice (tertiary nested widgets — `.jprice` nests a `.sfx` suffix that
  needs its own carve-out first).
- `linkName()` (vendor/part links, gmaps/calendar links) staying plain-text, not Ref-ified — the plan
  scoped Ref-ification to "unit/invoice sub-rows" specifically, which are already done; extending it to
  every `linkName()` call site app-wide is a broader visual decision outside this plan's stated scope.

**Slice 4 (2026-07-21, "/build until you don't need me") — section/plate state colour, further pushed:**
- Applied the mockup's plate grammar (coloured LEFT-BORDER stripe = section state) to BOTH field-group
  containers the real app already has: `.acct` (Units' 5 collapsible sections) and `.section` (the
  static field boxes on Rentals/Customers/vendors/parts/everywhere else) — narrowed from a full-
  perimeter border-color to a 3px stripe, dropped the base theme's `.sec-red` glow (`wrangler-style`:
  "matte, no glow"), moved section/plate labels to the stamped mono voice.
- Units' Specs section: `sec-green` → `sec-gray` (plain facts, no health state — green is Done
  specifically under the colour law, gray is not-applicable).
- Units' Investment "Profit" line: added `big:true` (an EXISTING `kv()` option) → 28px, the style
  ladder's own "value" rung — the mockup's headline-number treatment, without touching the `.side`/
  `.side.r` column layout it lives in.
- **Confirmed NOT built (genuine layout/UX decisions, not colour)**: the mockup's boxed `.num` CARD
  (pulling Profit out of its column into a bordered callout — would unbalance the existing 4-row
  `.side.r` symmetry without a browser check); the Customers Invoices KPI grid (Open/Invoices/1yr avg/
  Avg pay — the data isn't bundled anywhere today, "Avg pay" exists only as a standalone row-chip
  elsewhere); the inline rental-window mini-calendar (no existing equivalent); and whether Rentals/
  Customers' always-open `.section` boxes should BECOME collapsible like Units' `.acct` (today they
  never collapse; the mockup shows every section collapsible by default) — an interaction-model call.
