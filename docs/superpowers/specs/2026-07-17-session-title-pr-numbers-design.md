# Session title = PR numbers — design

**Date:** 2026-07-17 · **Status:** design approved (implementation is a follow-up) ·
**Origin:** Jac — *"I need the numbers in the session title… when more are created the
session title should be updated."* Brainstormed 2026-07-17; capability verified against
the Claude Code docs via the `claude-code-guide` agent.

> **This is a design-only artifact.** It was written on the `claude/popup-question-format`
> branch (#669) because that was this session's designated branch; the implementation
> (hook + workflow rule) is a separate deliverable and can be routed to its own feature
> branch → spec → plan → build cycle.

## Goal

The Claude Code **session title** automatically reflects the GitHub PR(s) this session
opened, and updates as PRs are created or land. Example — this very session would read:

```
#669 · popup question format
```

Multiple open PRs list ascending, sharing the label: `#669, #672 · popup question format`.

## What the platform actually allows (verified)

The design is shaped by three hard facts about Claude Code (docs-cited):

1. **Only a `SessionStart` hook can set the title** — via `hookSpecificOutput.sessionTitle`.
   It fires on `startup` and on every `resume` (`--resume` / `--continue` / `/resume`).
2. **No `PostToolUse` / `Stop` hook can set the title.** So nothing fires *the instant* a
   PR is created — a hook alone can only refresh at start/resume.
3. **The model cannot self-invoke `/rename`.** Slash commands are user-only input. The
   *instant* mid-session update therefore requires a human tap on a `/rename` line.

Consequence: a fully hands-free, instant-on-PR-create title is **not** achievable. The
design gets ~95% there by combining an automatic resume-refresh with a one-tap instant
update.

## Design — three cooperating pieces

### ① The record — a best-effort scratch file

- A **gitignored** file (proposed `.claude/.session-prs`, added to `.gitignore`) holding
  the **currently-open** PR numbers this session opened, one per line (or a comma list).
- **The assistant maintains it:** append a number on PR-create; remove it when that PR
  **merges/closes** (observed via `/merge` or a `<github-webhook-activity>` event).
- **Best-effort by design:** gitignored → no repo noise. On a fresh-container reclaim the
  file is gone, so the title falls back until the next PR or `/rename`. This trade-off was
  chosen deliberately over a committed file (repo noise) or a live GitHub query (needs a
  token reachable from a shell hook, which cloud may not provide).
- Because each cloud session gets its own fresh clone/container, a repo-local gitignored
  file is effectively session-scoped.

### ② The `SessionStart` hook (matcher: `startup` + `resume`)

- Reads the scratch file. If present and non-empty, computes the title and emits:
  ```json
  { "hookSpecificOutput": { "hookEventName": "SessionStart", "sessionTitle": "#669 · popup question format" } }
  ```
- **Title = `#<n>[, #<n>…] · <label>`**, numbers ascending.
- **`<label>` = branch de-slugified:** strip the `claude/` prefix and the trailing
  `-<id>` suffix, replace hyphens with spaces
  (`claude/popup-question-format-1f0oz6` → `popup question format`).
- **Respect manual renames:** the hook sets the title **only** if the current title still
  looks auto-managed (the default `dir-XX` pattern, or a title matching this hook's own
  `#… · …` shape) — it never clobbers a name set by hand.

### ③ The post-PR workflow rule (`CLAUDE.md` + `/start`)

Because the model can't self-`/rename`, whenever the assistant **opens or lands** a PR it:
1. Updates the scratch file (append on open; remove on merge/close), and
2. Surfaces a ready-to-run line for a one-tap instant update:
   ```
   /rename #669 · popup question format
   ```
This is the instant path between resumes; the hook (②) is the automatic backstop.

## Data flow

```
PR created ──▶ assistant appends # to .session-prs ──▶ prints "/rename #… · label" line
                                                          │
                                              Jac taps it ▼  (instant title update)
session resumed later ──▶ SessionStart(resume) hook reads .session-prs ──▶ sets title
                          (skipped if Jac hand-renamed the session)
PR merges/closes ──▶ assistant removes # from .session-prs ──▶ prints updated "/rename" line
```

## Scope / YAGNI

- **In:** PRs the assistant opens **this session** (recorded). Ascending order. Only
  currently-open PRs in the title (merged/closed drop off). Respect manual renames.
- **Out:** arbitrary PRs the assistant didn't open; multi-branch reconciliation; a
  committed record; a live GitHub query in the hook; keeping merged PRs in the title.

## Open implementation questions (resolve in the plan, not blocking design)

1. **Exact scratch path + `.gitignore` entry** — confirm `.claude/.session-prs` doesn't
   collide with tracked `.claude/` content and is cleanly ignored.
2. **Does the `SessionStart` hook input expose the current title?** Needed for the
   respect-manual-rename check. If it does not, fall back to a **"last-title-I-set" marker
   file**: the hook records the title it emits; on the next fire, if the live title differs
   from that marker and isn't the default pattern, treat it as a manual rename and skip.
3. **De-slugify edge cases** — branches not matching `claude/<slug>-<id>` (e.g. a
   `parked/…` or bare name): fall back to the raw branch name as the label.

## Testing

- **Hook unit check:** given a `.session-prs` fixture, the hook emits the expected
  `sessionTitle` JSON; empty/missing file → no title emitted (leave as-is).
- **De-slugify:** `claude/popup-question-format-1f0oz6` → `popup question format`;
  a non-matching branch → raw name.
- **Respect-manual-rename:** with a marker file present and a divergent live title, the
  hook emits no `sessionTitle`.
- **Workflow rule (manual/CI-observable):** creating a PR appends to the file and prints a
  `/rename` line; landing it removes the number.

## Success criteria

- Opening a PR yields a one-tap `/rename` line and a title reflecting it after the tap.
- Resuming the session re-derives the title from open PRs automatically.
- A hand-set title survives a resume (not overwritten).
- No tracked-file churn from the feature (record stays gitignored).
