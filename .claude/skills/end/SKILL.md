description: Close out a Claude Code session on the trunk workflow — report what's actually shipped (merged to trunk vs promoted to production vs still pending/uncommitted), sweep loose ideas or half-done threads onto their own parked branches so nothing is lost, refuse to archive while anything is pending/parked/uncommitted, then archive the chat. Replaces tidy-sessions, which only archived. Use when a feature is done, a session is winding down, or chats pile up. Invoke with /end.

# /end — capture, close out, archive

Closes a session properly on the trunk model: one `trunk` (the trunk branch),
short-lived feature branches, a `production` release-pointer branch. Runs FOUR
jobs, strictly in order — the archive step only fires once the first three are
clean. Replaces `tidy-sessions`, which only did job 4.

## 1. Report shipped-state plainly
Don't let the session end on a fuzzy "did this actually ship?". Keep this to a
few **scannable lines — one per bucket**, not a wall; it's context for the popup
that follows, never prose to hunt through for the ask. Check and state all three,
even when a bucket is empty:
- **PROMOTED (live):** `git log origin/production..origin/trunk --oneline` —
  empty means `trunk` IS what's live; anything listed is on the trunk but
  **not yet promoted**.
- **MERGED TO TRUNK, not yet promoted:** the output of the check above.
- **PENDING / uncommitted:** `git status -sb` on the current branch/worktree,
  plus any feature branch this session pushed that never merged.
- **Worktree state**, if this session ran in a `claude --worktree`: name it,
  say whether its work already landed on `trunk`. Landed → cleanup candidate
  for job 4. Not landed → it's PENDING and blocks archive under job 3.
- Write this into a short handoff note (session-output folder) so the next
  session — this one resuming, or a fresh one — doesn't have to re-derive it.

## 2. Catch loose work before it's lost
The job `tidy-sessions` never did, and the one Jac most wanted. Scan for
anything worth keeping that isn't already cleanly shipped or committed to a
tracked branch:
- `git status -sb` / `git diff` for uncommitted or untracked changes not
  already covered by job 1's shipped report.
- `git stash list` — anything stashed and forgotten.
- Skim the session itself for ideas Jac raised or Claude proposed and then
  deferred — cue phrases like "later," "not now," "someday," "good idea but
  skip," "table this," "follow-up." A verbal idea with zero code still
  counts if it's worth keeping.
- Any half-built function/file left mid-edit in the working tree that isn't
  part of the shipping diff.

For each candidate, confirm with Jac via an `AskUserQuestion` popup (one attempt; if
it fails, present the same short list inline as lettered **A/B/C… + Other**) with the
choices: **park it**, **keep working it now instead of ending the session**, or
**drop it**. Default suggestion is park — it's cheap and reversible; dropping needs an
explicit yes.

**Mechanics for parking (every confirmed item):**
1. **Name it** `parked/<short-kebab-slug>` — e.g. `parked/dark-mode-toggle`.
   Add a date prefix only if the slug could collide or timing matters:
   `parked/2026-07-12-dark-mode-toggle`.
2. **Branch it** off the trunk (or off the current feature branch, if the
   loose work only makes sense on top of it — say which and why):
   `git checkout trunk && git pull && git checkout -b parked/<slug>`.
3. **Commit the loose work** with a message that stands alone months later —
   what it is, why it was parked, what's left:
   ```
   Park: <one-line description>

   Deferred from <origin branch/session> on <date>.
   Needs: <what's left to finish it>.
   ```
   For an idea with no code yet, commit a short markdown note (e.g. under
   `docs/superpowers/notes/`) instead of an empty branch — the note IS the
   artifact.
4. **Push it:** `git push -u origin parked/<slug>`.
5. **Note it** — open a draft PR so it's discoverable without merging:
   `gh pr create --draft --title "[parked] <slug>" --body "<what it is, why
   parked, what's left>"`. Draft PRs surface via `gh pr list --draft`, so a
   later session (or the next `/end` run) can resurface stale
   parked work instead of it rotting silently.
6. **Return** to the branch you were on before parking — never leave the
   session sitting on a parked branch.
7. List every parked branch + its draft-PR link in the job-1 handoff note.

## 3. Guard against premature archive
If job 1 found anything PENDING/uncommitted, or job 2 found a loose thread
that's still undecided (or Jac chose to keep working it now) — **do NOT
archive**. Don't dump the blockers as prose for Jac to parse: surface them in an
`AskUserQuestion` popup — a one-line state summary above, then the actions that
would clear each block as the options (e.g. **merge #669 now**, **promote it**,
**park the CSV-export idea**, **leave it — I'll handle it**), **multiSelect** when
several blocks are independent so Jac clears them in one shot. Jac picks the
unblock action right there instead of hunting the report for what to do. One
popup attempt; if it fails, the same choices inline as lettered **A/B/C… +
Other**. Same conservative posture `tidy-sessions` applied to archiving, moved one
step earlier to cover the whole close-out.

## 4. Archive the chat reliably — last step, only once 1–3 are clean
The old `tidy-sessions` job, unchanged in spirit:
1. List sessions with `mcp__ccd_session_mgmt__list_sessions`. If unavailable
   (e.g. a cloud run), say so and point Jac to archive in the Claude app.
2. Identify candidates conservatively: no activity in 7+ days, OR the
   session's branch is merged/gone (cross-check `gh pr list --state merged`
   / `git ls-remote`). Never flag the current session or one with an open
   PR, or no PR yet.
3. **If this session ran in a worktree and job 1 confirmed its work already
   landed on `trunk`, clean it up now** — remove the worktree
   (`ExitWorktree` / `git worktree remove`) so it doesn't linger as a stale
   checkout.
4. Present candidates as a short table (title · last activity · branch
   status) via `AskUserQuestion` (**multiSelect**; one attempt, and if it fails
   the same list inline as lettered **A/B/C… + Other**); default-select the
   clearly-done ones, let Jac deselect.
5. Archive the confirmed ones with `mcp__ccd_session_mgmt__archive_session`.
   Report what was archived, what was kept, and what was cleaned up.

## Rules
- **Never skip ahead.** Job 4 cannot run before 1–3 are clean — that
  ordering is the whole point of replacing `tidy-sessions`.
- **Never archive or park without confirmation.** Both are reversible, but
  silent action isn't welcome — surface the choice via the `AskUserQuestion`
  popup (one attempt; if it fails, the same choice inline as **A/B/C… + Other**).
- **Never archive the active session.**
- Default conservative throughout: unsure whether something's finished →
  leave it, ask.
- **Refresh `MEMORY.md` before archiving.** Append this session's durable
  decisions, new gotchas, and design prefs to `MEMORY.md` (public-safe — no
  PII / pricing / secrets), and prune Open threads that have closed. It's the
  git-committed cross-session brain a fresh cloud clone starts from.
- **Staging cleanup isn't `/end`'s job.** The default **deck** deploys are
  ephemeral — pruned by retention (newest 20 kept) — so there's nothing to
  release or clean up here. Only the `--slots` backup path holds anything
  that needs releasing, and that's already handled by `/merge`'s step 5 and
  `/promote`'s step 4 (soft, best-effort slot release) — not repeated here.
- **Out of scope, by design:** driving Gate 1 ("merge it") or Gate 2
  ("promote it"), and "landing" work beyond reporting + parking. That's the
  `start` skill's two-gate deploy loop, not this one.
